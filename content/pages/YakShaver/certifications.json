In your [YakShaver portal](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/), add a project called 'Northwind' and set the backlog to this public GitHub repo: [https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.YakShaver.Playground](https://github.com/SSWConsulting/SSW.YakShaver.Playground)\n\n2\\. Set up a [Windows or Mac screenshot tool](https://yakshaver.ai/docs/recording-work-item-snipping-tool) by following the docs.\\\nNote: This gives you access to keyboard shortcuts\n\n3\\. Read the Shaving [best practices](https://yakshaver.ai/docs/user-mention-guidelines-in-work-item-descriptions).\n\n4\\. Do a Shave into the 'Northwind' project. In your recording, explain to us:\n\n* The project's location in the portal, and its backlog.\n* How you have set up your screen capture tool, and where the videos will go after being recorded\n* Why you must verbally mention the destination project and why you can't just rely on the screen.\n\n5\\. We will review your answers, and if successful you will receive an email with your badge.\n\n6\\. Accept and share the badge on LinkedIn.\n",
