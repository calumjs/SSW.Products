## Overview

SSW EagleEye is an AI-powered email management solution that helps organizations categorize and process emails automatically using Azure OpenAI. This guide will walk you through the installation process using Azure Managed Applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have:

- **Azure Subscription** with Owner permissions
- **Azure AD Tenant** with Global Administrator or Application Administrator privileges
- **Azure OpenAI** quota available in your subscription
- **Power BI** workspace (optional, for reporting)
- **Custom domain** and DNS zone in Azure (optional)

## Deployment Types

### Current Deployment Method: Service Catalog

SSW EagleEye is currently deployed via Azure Service Catalog for internal testing and validation.

### Future Deployment Method: Azure Marketplace

> **TODO**: Azure Marketplace deployment will be available in the future, providing:
>
> - Public availability to all Azure customers
> - Streamlined deployment process
> - Production-ready managed application

_Note: This guide currently covers Service Catalog deployment. It will be updated when Azure Marketplace deployment becomes available._

## Installation Process

### Phase 1: Deploy Managed Application

#### Step 1: Access the Managed Application

1. Go to **Azure Portal** > **All services** > **Service Catalog Managed Applications**
2. Find **SSW EagleEye** in the catalog
3. Click **Create**

> **Note**: Azure Marketplace deployment will be available in the future and will provide a streamlined experience through the Azure Marketplace.

#### Step 2: Configure Application Settings

Follow the deployment wizard with these configuration steps:

##### 2.1 Application Configuration

- **Project Name**: Enter a unique prefix (3-15 characters, lowercase letters and numbers)
- **Environment**: Select `production` or `staging`
- **Location**: Choose your preferred Azure region

##### 2.2 Azure AD Configuration

- **Azure Tenant ID**: Your Azure AD tenant ID
- **Azure Group Name**: Enter the Azure AD group name for email processing

##### 2.3 App Registration Configuration

You can select existing app registrations or create new ones during this step:

- **SSW.EagleEye App Registration**: Select the Engine app registration and enter the client secret
- **SSW.EagleEye.Api App Registration**: Select the API app registration and enter the client secret
- **API Scope URL**: Enter the full scope URL from the API app registration
- **SSW.EagleEye.Portal App Registration**: Select the Portal app registration and enter the client secret

> **Note**: If you don't have existing app registrations, you can create them during deployment or refer to the **App Registration Creation Guide** section below for detailed instructions.

##### 2.4 Database Configuration

- **Database Pricing Tier**: Select appropriate tier (Basic, S0, S1, S2)
- **Database Users**: Configure three database users:
  - Admin user (full access)
  - ReadWrite user (read/write access)
  - ReadOnly user (read-only access)

##### 2.5 Azure OpenAI Configuration

- **Location**: Select Azure region (currently East US)
- **Model**: Choose GPT-4.1 Mini or GPT-4o Mini
- **Capacity**: Set tokens per minute (verify your quota first)

##### 2.6 Power BI Configuration (Optional)

- **Power BI Embed URL**: Enter embed URL for reports
- **Power BI Report URL**: Enter direct report URL

##### 2.7 Domain Configuration (Optional)

- **Custom Domain**: Enter your custom domain
- **DNS Resource Group**: Specify where your DNS zone is located

#### Step 3: Review and Deploy

1. Review all configuration settings
2. Click **Create** to start deployment
3. Monitor deployment progress in the Azure Portal
4. Deployment typically takes 15-30 minutes

### Phase 2: Post-Deployment Configuration

#### Step 4: Configure Portal Frontend Redirect URL

After deployment completes, you need to configure the authentication redirect URL:

1. Go to **Resource Groups** > **[your-resource-group]** > **Container Apps**
2. Find the Portal container app (e.g., `ca-nextjs-xxxxxx`)
3. Copy the **Application URL** (e.g., `https://ca-nextjs-4d33i5xxemxsu.happyfield-d167da8e.australiaeast.azurecontainerapps.io`)
4. Go to **Azure AD** > **App registrations** > **SSW.EagleEye.Portal**
5. Go to **Authentication** > **Add a platform** > **Web**
6. Add redirect URI: `[Application URL]/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`
   - Example: `https://ca-nextjs-4d33i5xxemxsu.happyfield-d167da8e.australiaeast.azurecontainerapps.io/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`
7. Click **Save**

#### Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. **Access the Portal**: Navigate to the Portal container app URL
2. **Test Authentication**: Sign in with your Azure AD credentials
3. **Check API Connectivity**: Verify the Portal can communicate with the API
4. **Test Email Processing**: Run a manual job to categorize emails

## Architecture Overview

The deployed solution includes:

- **Container Apps Environment**: Hosting the API, CLI, and Portal
- **Azure SQL Database**: Data storage with configured user access
- **Azure OpenAI**: AI processing for email categorization
- **Key Vault**: Secure storage of secrets and configurations
- **Application Insights**: Monitoring and telemetry
- **Container Registry**: Docker image storage

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. Configure Email Tags
2. Set Up Power BI
