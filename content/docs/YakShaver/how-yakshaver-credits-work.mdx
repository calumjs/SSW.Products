YakShaver runs on a simple credit system, so you always know where you stand.

## What's a credit?

One **credit** = **one video recording successfully processed** by YakShaver, easy!

## Credit types

* **Monthly credits** - the bundle that comes with the plan you signed up for (Starter, Team, or Growth).
* **Credit packs** - extra packs you buy whenever you need them.

## Do credits roll over?

* **Monthly credits** refresh to your plan's full allowance at the start of every billing month.
* **Credit packs** **never expire**. They stay in your account until you use them.

## Which credits get used first?

YakShaver automatically spends your **monthly credits first**. Once they hit zero, we start dipping into your **credit packs**. \
This saves your non-expiring packs for when you really need them.

## Out of monthly credits?

* **[Upgrade your plan](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/plan)** – pay the price difference and get the extra credits right away.
  * *Example:* upgrading from **Team** (AU $39, 100 credits) to **Growth** (AU $189, 500 credits) costs **AU $150** and instantly gives you **+400 credits**.
* **Buy a credit pack** – add **50 extra credits** for **AU $25**. Credit packs never expire.

## Keeping track

Your remaining credits are shown in the top-right corner of the [Subscription page](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/plan).
