If you are on Mac, here's how you can set up the inbuilt [Screenshots App](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/mac-help/mh26782/mac) to get your videos processed by YakShaver!

## Setting up the Screenshot App

1. **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** YakShaver | Type **OFF** in the YakShaver Teams bot. This will prevent old videos from being processed.
2. **Video Storage Location:** Videos can be stored anywhere under the 'Recordings' folder, either directly or in nested folders. YakShaver will process videos from any location within the Recordings folder structure.

   **Examples of valid storage locations:**
   - **Direct storage:** `OneDrive\Recordings\` (files directly in the Recordings folder)
   - **Nested folders:** 
     - `OneDrive\Recordings\ScreenshotApp\`
     - `OneDrive\Recordings\MacOS\Screenshots\`
     - `OneDrive\Recordings\Projects\ProjectName\`

3. Choose your preferred storage location within the Recordings folder (e.g., create a new folder called `ScreenshotApp` for organization)
4. Screenshot App | Press `CMD + Shift + 5` to open the Screenshot App
5. Screenshot App | Options
   1. Save to | Select "Other Location", and choose your preferred location within the Recordings folder
   2. Microphone | Select the correct input
6. YakShaver | Type **ON** in the YakShaver Teams bot.
