## Making Videos Permanent

If you want your videos to remain permanently available, you can connect your **YouTube** account to the project. Once connected, uploaded videos will be published to your YouTube account and won't expire.

**⚠️ YouTube Limitations:**
- **Daily quota**: Only ~100 video uploads per verified channel per day
- **Security**: If unlisted links are accidentally shared, anyone can access them
- **No organizational control**: Videos are hosted on YouTube, not your organization's infrastructure

## How to set up YouTube uploads:

1. Go to the project where you want to upload videos through the [portal](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/projects)
2. [Connect your YouTube account](/docs/connect-your-youtube-channel-to-a-project) (if you haven't already)
3. Create a shave for that project - it will be published to your YouTube channel unlisted and won't expire

**Note**: The 30-day expiry for SharePoint links is a security best practice to ensure content remains current and reduces long-term storage and security risks. YouTube hosting should only be used when permanent access is truly required, keeping in mind the daily upload limits and security considerations.
