**⚠️ Warning:** By default, videos shared by YakShaver via **OneDrive** expire after 30 days. This is part of our sharing rules to ensure content stays current and storage use remains efficient.

If you want your videos to remain permanently available, you will need to connect your **YouTube** account to the project. Once connected, uploaded videos will be published to your YouTube account and won't expire.

How to make uploads permanent:

1. Go to the project where you want to upload videos through the [portal](https://portal.yakshaver.ai/settings/projects)
2. [Connect your YouTube account](/docs/connect-your-youtube-channel-to-a-project) (if you haven’t already)
3. Create a shave for that project - it will be published to your YouTube channel unlisted and won’t expire
