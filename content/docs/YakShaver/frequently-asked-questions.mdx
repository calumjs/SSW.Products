## 3. Why are so many people CC'd on my Work Item?

When a work item is created, anyone mentioned in the transcript is automatically added to the conversation. For project-related items, the primary contact and all project members are also tagged to ensure visibility and alignment across the team.

## 4. Why are my GitHub issues being created by YakShaver instead of my account?

To create and edit issues under your GitHub account, you'll need to connect your GitHub account to YakShaver. This ensures issues are properly attributed to you and gives you full editing capabilities. See [Connect your GitHub account](/docs/connect-your-github-account) for setup instructions.
